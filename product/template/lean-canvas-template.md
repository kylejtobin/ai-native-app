# Lean Canvas

Single-page business model validation. Used at inception to test whether this is worth building. Becomes historical context once validated.

---

## Problem

**Top 3 problems worth solving:**

1. [Most critical problem]
2. [Second problem]
3. [Third problem]

**Existing alternatives**: [How do people solve these problems today?]

---

## Customer Segments

**Target customers:**

1. [Primary segment - be specific about who, not everyone]
2. [Secondary segment, if applicable]

**Early adopters**: [Who will use this before it's polished? These are your first customers.]

---

## Unique Value Proposition

**Single, clear message that states why you're different and worth paying attention to:**

[One sentence. If you can't say it in one sentence, you don't have clarity yet.]

**High-level concept**: [X for Y analogy, if helpful - e.g., "Uber for laundry"]

---

## Solution

**Top 3 features or capabilities that address the top 3 problems:**

1. [Solution to Problem 1]
2. [Solution to Problem 2]
3. [Solution to Problem 3]

*Note: Keep this minimal. You're validating the business model, not designing the product.*

---

## Channels

**Path to customers:**

- **Awareness**: [How do they learn you exist?]
- **Evaluation**: [How do they decide to try you?]
- **Delivery**: [How do they access the product?]

---

## Revenue Streams

**How you make money:**

- [Primary revenue model]
- [Secondary revenue model, if applicable]

**Pricing approach**: [Subscription, usage-based, transaction fee, etc.]

---

## Cost Structure

**Major costs to operate:**

- [Fixed costs: what you pay regardless of scale]
- [Variable costs: what scales with usage/customers]

**Key resources required**: [What must you have/build/acquire?]

---

## Key Metrics

**Indicators that the business model is working:**

- [Metric 1 - hypothesis about what matters]
- [Metric 2]
- [Metric 3]

*⚠️ Important: These are hypotheses to test, not commitments or predictions. Per the outcome-focused roadmapping philosophy, actual measurement happens empirically during and after execution. These metrics may prove to be wrong proxies - that's expected. List them to make your assumptions explicit and testable, not to lock in targets.*

---

## Unfair Advantage

**What makes you defensible - something that cannot be easily copied or bought:**

[Be honest. Most early-stage ventures don't have one yet. "Nothing yet" is a valid answer that highlights a risk to address.]

Possible sources: insider information, expert endorsements, existing audience, proprietary technology, network effects, community, regulatory advantages, team expertise.

## Notes

### Purpose of This Document

Lean Canvas validates whether a business is worth building. It operates upstream of product planning:

1. **Lean Canvas** → Is this viable? (Business model validation)
2. **Vision** → What future are we creating? (Aspirational direction)
3. **Roadmap** → What capabilities, in what order? (Strategic planning)
4. **Outcomes/Specs/Plans/Tasks** → How do we build it? (Execution)

### When to Use

- **At inception**: Before committing significant resources
- **At pivot points**: When fundamental model assumptions change
- **For new product lines**: Each distinct business model gets its own canvas

### When NOT to Use

- For feature planning (use roadmap and specs)
- For existing products with validated models (canvas becomes historical reference)
- As an ongoing planning document (it's a snapshot, not a living doc)

### Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Fill in with best current hypotheses
2. **Test**: Run experiments to validate/invalidate assumptions
3. **Iterate**: Update as you learn (expect multiple versions)
4. **Archive**: Once model is validated, canvas becomes historical context

### Relationship to Metrics Philosophy

This framework treats measurement as empirical work, not predictive specification. The Key Metrics box above contains *hypotheses about what might matter*, not *commitments to hit numbers*.

Once you move to execution (roadmap → outcomes → specs), metrics disappear from planning documents. You describe capabilities to build, not numbers to hit. Measurement happens during/after shipping as separate empirical work.

The Lean Canvas metrics are part of experiment design: "We believe X metric will indicate business viability. Let's test that." They're falsifiable hypotheses, not goals.
