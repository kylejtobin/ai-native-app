# Product Roadmap

Three-horizon outcome-based roadmap. Outcomes slide from Later → Next → Now as they gain refinement and commitment.

---

## Now (next 3 months)

Committed work with active planning and implementation.

- [Outcome Name](outcomes/outcome-name.md) - [Status]

---

## Next (3-6 months)

Directional commitments gaining specificity.

- [Outcome Name](outcomes/outcome-name.md) - [Status]

---

## Later (6-12 months)

Exploratory capabilities under consideration.

- [Outcome Name](outcomes/outcome-name.md) - [Status]

---

## Notes

- Only "Now" outcomes flow into `planning/` for spec/plan/tasks
- Outcomes refine as they slide through horizons
- Each outcome links to detailed file in `outcomes/`
- Status: Exploring (Later), Committed (Next), In Progress (Now), Shipped
- No metrics - outcomes describe capabilities, not predicted value
