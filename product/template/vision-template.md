# Product Vision

The future state this product exists to create. Stable foundation that everything else serves.

---

## The World We're Creating

[Describe the aspirational future state - not your product, but the world that exists because your product succeeded. This should be vivid enough to align decisions but abstract enough to survive strategy pivots.]

---

## Who Benefits and How

**Primary beneficiary**: [Who experiences the transformed state most directly]

**The transformation**: [From current reality] → [To envisioned future]

**Why this matters**: [The human or organizational need this addresses]

---

## What Makes This Vision Distinctive

[What perspective, belief, or approach distinguishes your vision from others working in this space? This isn't feature differentiation - it's worldview differentiation.]

---

## Boundaries

**This vision is about**: [The core domain or problem space]

**This vision is NOT about**: [Adjacent spaces you're explicitly not pursuing]

## Notes

### What Belongs Here
- Aspirational future state (world, not product)
- Human or organizational transformation
- Stable beliefs that survive strategy changes
- 3-5+ year time horizon

### What Does NOT Belong Here
- Product features or capabilities (those go in roadmap)
- Metrics or quantitative targets (measurement is empirical work)
- Timelines or milestones (those go in roadmap)
- Implementation details (those go in specs/plans)
- Competitive positioning (that goes in lean canvas)

### Stability Test
If your roadmap priorities shift dramatically, does the vision still hold? If yes, it's at the right abstraction level. If the vision needs to change when tactics change, it's too detailed.

### Relationship to Other Documents
- **Vision** answers: Why does this product exist? What future are we creating?
- **Lean Canvas** answers: Is this a viable business? What's the model?
- **Roadmap** answers: What capabilities, in what order?
- **Outcomes** answer: What specific state changes are we pursuing?

Vision is the stable context that makes all downstream prioritization coherent.
